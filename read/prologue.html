                <p>The desert taught him about distance. First, the physical kind: miles stretching between outposts, between bodies, between then and now. Later, the kind that exists in the mind. The separation between past and present, war and peace, who he was and who he became.</p>

                <p>There is a third kind of distance the desert never taught; the space between a man and everyone around him, measured not in miles but in frequencies. The distance of standing in a crowded room while something by Maynard James Keenan bleeds through the speakers, watching mouths move in conversation, knowing the words are meant for someone capable of receiving them. That distance cannot be crossed by vehicle or foot. It exists in the architecture of the self, in rooms built during war and never dismantled, in hallways that lead only to other hallways, each door opening onto another empty chamber where echoes mistake themselves for company.</p>

                <p>At eighteen, barely a man, he found himself in Kuwait, then quickly thrust into the invasion of Iraq. His unit rolled across the border in the opening days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, a reconnaissance team in Humvees navigating terrain that looked nothing like the lush forests of his LRRP books that had compelled him to enlist. Barely more than a year later, he would find himself in urban combat in Ramadi with the light infantry, clearing houses and patrolling streets that reeked of garbage and char. Two deployments in a three-year contract. The military efficiency in extracting maximum utility from young men who hadn't yet learned to value their own lives.</p>

                <p>But war never really ended. It just stretched into something quieter, more insidious. The battlefield changed, but the fight remained. And the fight, he would eventually understand, was not against an external enemy. It was against a pattern etched into him long before he ever held a rifle. A pattern of surrender that whispered the same seduction at every threshold: walk away. It's easier in the dark. You were never going to make it anyway.</p>

                <p>There are nights when the isolation assumes physical form, a pressure system settling over his chest like weather that forgot to move on. The silence of his apartment becomes a presence rather than an absence, something with weight and intention, pressing against his ribs with the patience of geology. On these nights, the thought arrives not as intruder but as familia, an old song he knows all the words to, something by Alice in Chains perhaps, Layne Staley's voice asking questions that don't require answers. It would be so easy to end it all. The thought carries no violence, no drama. It presents itself as mathematics: the simple calculation that subtraction might solve what addition never could, that the equation of his existence might balance more cleanly at zero.</p>

                <p>The thought doesn't frighten him. It's simply there, a door that remains perpetually unlocked. He won't walk through it. Not yet. Maybe not ever. But knowing the door exists provides a strange comfort. A final control in a life where so much seems beyond his grasp.</p>

                <p>What keeps him here is not courage but something more stubborn: an inexplicable optimism that refuses to die. The belief that tomorrow might reveal something worth staying for. A thin thread, but so far, strong enough to hold him.</p>

                <p>He does not know yet what will thicken that thread into rope. Does not know that the pattern defining his life will meet its match not in discipline or achievement but in love. Does not know that somewhere ahead waits a woman who will look at the unlocked door and say the words no one has ever said: <em>don't quit on me</em>.</p>

                <p>But that is still ahead. For now, there is only the war outside and the longer one within. A man still learning that the hardest battle isn't against the enemy in front of him.</p>

                <p>It's against the part of himself that keeps reaching for the door.</p>
