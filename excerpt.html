            <p class="excerpt-block-label">Part IV · The Ghosts</p>
            <h2 class="excerpt-block-title">Survivor's Guilt</h2>
            <div class="excerpt-block-text">
                <p>The ghosts follow him, though most people can't see them. They sit in the empty chair across from him at breakfast. They ride shotgun on long drives. They stand at the foot of his bed on sleepless nights. Not metaphorical ghosts. He's too literal-minded for that. These are the actual dead, preserved in his memory with high-definition clarity.</p>
                <p>There's the soldier whose body he helped carry after the IED—a kid, really, barely old enough to vote, whose last words were about his mother. There's the interpreter who'd shown him photos of his daughters just hours before the mortar round found them both, though only one survived. There are the nameless ones, too: bodies glimpsed in the aftermath of firefights, faces he never learned but can't forget.</p>
                <p>But most persistent are Kuhns and Kinslow. They visit him more frequently than the others, their presence particularly acute during his morning shower as he brushes his teeth—a peculiar habit he's maintained for years, the water cascading over his shoulders as he methodically cleans each tooth, feeling the shape of them under the bristles.</p>
                <p>The tactile sensation inevitably conjures thoughts of Kuhns, of the teeth that should have been in Ramadi instead of his own.</p>
                <p>Kuhns was supposed to deploy. Had the orders. Had done the pre-deployment training. Then fate—or whatever you want to call it—intervened. A last-minute shuffle. Someone needed to stay back. Kuhns drew the short straw, or maybe the long one, depending on how you looked at it. Either way, the young Forward Observer from Indiana found himself watching his unit deploy without him.</p>
                <p>And Steve went in his place.</p>
                <p>Steve, who'd already done one tour. Steve, who could have stayed home. Steve, who volunteered to fill the gap because that's what you did when your unit needed you.</p>
                <p>Six months into that deployment, Kuhns was killed in a training accident stateside. A routine exercise gone wrong. The kind of death that makes no sense, that follows no narrative logic, that refuses to fit into any story about sacrifice or purpose.</p>
                <p>The news reached Steve in Ramadi. He read the email in the TOC, surrounded by the buzz of radios and the distant thump of outgoing artillery. Kuhns was dead. The man whose place he'd taken. The man who should have been standing where Steve was standing, breathing the dust Steve was breathing, brushing his teeth in whatever makeshift shower Steve was using.</p>

        <!-- Isolation Excerpt -->
        <article class="excerpt-block" id="isolation">
            <p class="excerpt-block-label">Part XI · The Pattern</p>
            <h2 class="excerpt-block-title">The Disconnected Generation</h2>
            <div class="excerpt-block-text">
                <p>Three men in three separate units, experiencing three variations of the same millennial condition—never more connected, never more alone.</p>
                <p>They had smartphones that could reach anyone on the planet in seconds, yet went weeks without meaningful human contact. They had social media profiles that broadcasted their lives to hundreds of followers, yet couldn't remember the last time someone had asked how they really were. They had dating apps that promised connection with a swipe, yet found themselves swiping past midnight, searching for something they couldn't name.</p>
                <p>Steve recognized the pattern because he'd lived it himself. The strategic retreat. The preemptive withdrawal. The art of leaving before you could be left, of ending things before they ended you. It was a survival mechanism that had served him well in certain contexts—you couldn't grieve what you'd already released—but it had costs he was only beginning to understand.</p>
                <p>Each relationship followed the same arc: the initial rush of connection, the gradual deepening of intimacy, and then, inevitably, the moment when he could feel the walls closing in. Not their walls. His own. The claustrophobic sensation of being truly known, of having someone see past the carefully constructed exterior to whatever lay beneath.</p>
                <p>That's when he would start manufacturing distance. Small withdrawals at first—cancelled plans, unreturned calls, the subtle art of being physically present but emotionally absent. Then larger ones. The sudden discovery of irreconcilable differences. The conviction that this wasn't working, couldn't work, had been a mistake from the start.</p>
                <p>And always, always, the exit. Clean and decisive. Better to be the one who leaves than the one who is left. Better to control the ending than to let it control you.</p>

        <!-- Redemption Excerpt -->
        <article class="excerpt-block" id="redemption">
            <p class="excerpt-block-label">Part XVII · Breaking the Pattern</p>
            <h2 class="excerpt-block-title">The Immovable Object</h2>
            <div class="excerpt-block-text">
                <p>For the first time in his life, the pain of leaving would exceed the pain of staying. She became the immovable object his pattern couldn't overcome.</p>
                <p>It wasn't that she was perfect. She wasn't. She had her own damage, her own walls, her own moments of distance and withdrawal. But she also had something he'd never encountered before: a stubborn refusal to let him disappear.</p>
                <p>When he pulled back, she stepped forward. When he manufactured distance, she closed it. When he deployed his usual arsenal of exit strategies—the sudden coldness, the invented conflicts, the rational explanations for why this couldn't work—she simply... stayed.</p>
                <p>"I'm not going anywhere," she said. "You can push all you want. I'll still be here."</p>
                <p>He didn't know what to do with that. His whole system was built on the assumption that people left. That love was a temporary condition, a brief respite before the inevitable abandonment. He had spent decades perfecting the art of leaving first, only to find someone who refused to let him practice it.</p>
                <p>The first few months were terrifying. Every day he woke up waiting for her to realize her mistake, to see through his carefully constructed competence to the broken thing beneath. Every night he went to sleep wondering if this would be the last night, if tomorrow would bring the conversation he'd been expecting his whole life: "I can't do this anymore."</p>
                <p>But the conversation never came. Instead, there were smaller moments. A hand reaching for his in the darkness. A voice asking about his day and actually listening to the answer. A presence that remained constant even when he tested it, even when he tried to drive it away.</p>
                <p>Slowly, imperceptibly, something began to shift. Not the fear—that remained, probably always would—but his relationship to it. He began to see the pattern for what it was: not protection, but prison. Not survival, but slow death. He had been so focused on avoiding the pain of loss that he'd never allowed himself the risk of connection.</p>
